# card agent notes

Scoped working memory for the `card` specialist. Update before finishing
any task: decisions made, open questions, current state worth resuming
from. This is what makes a fresh respawn cheap — don't rely on transcript
resume alone (session transcripts are swept after ~30 days).

## Decisions

- 2026-09-07: Fixed prod 500 on POST /api/card/fin/1 (Netlify Function
  ENOENT scandir '/var/task/functional-model'). Root cause:
  `server/api/card/[set]/[number].ts`'s `loadFunctionalModel` (added in
  d9f749e, "compute functional-model traces live") does raw
  `fs.readdirSync`/`readFileSync` against `functional-model/` and spawns
  `node_modules/.bin/vite-node` as a child process to actually execute a
  card's `scenarios.ts`/engine core, at request time. None of that ships
  in a Netlify Function bundle (Nitro's Rollup bundler only ships files it
  can statically trace as imports; `functional-model/`'s raw .ts sources
  and the vite-node dev binary are read/spawned dynamically, never
  imported). Every OTHER functional-model/ fs access in this route family
  already tolerated a missing dir via try/catch (`loadFunctionalModelPool`
  → `[]`, `loadCardSynergy` → `null`, `review-status.ts`'s explicit
  `NODE_ENV==='production'` 403 guard) — `sharedEngineSignature`'s
  `readdirSync` was the one place that didn't, called BEFORE
  `loadFunctionalModel`'s own try/catch even started.
  Fix: `loadFunctionalModel` now returns `null` outright when
  `NODE_ENV==='production'`, same convention/comment style as
  `review-status.ts`. Also hardened `sharedEngineSignature` itself with a
  try/catch (defense in depth) in case it's ever called from a path that
  isn't NODE_ENV-guarded. Frontend already renders `functionalModel: null`
  as the normal "no functional-model entry for this card yet" state
  (`v-if="data?.functionalModel"` in
  `app/pages/app/card/[set]/[number].vue`) — this is the same common case
  corpus-wide (most cards don't have a functional-model entry), so no UI
  change needed.
  Validated: `npm run build` (nitro netlify preset) + directly invoking the
  built `.netlify/functions-internal/server/main.mjs` handler with
  `NODE_ENV=production` and a real `Request` — confirmed 200 (not 500),
  `functionalModel: null`, `interactions` still populated (that path was
  never broken, already try/catch-safe). Also confirmed via grep that
  `sharedEngineSignature`/`vite-node`/`computeTracesLive` are fully
  dead-code-eliminated out of the production bundle entirely (Vite/Rollup
  statically resolves `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to `true`
  at build time and DCEs the unreachable branch) — the crash source isn't
  just runtime-guarded, it's physically absent from what ships. Confirmed
  local dev (`npm run dev`, already-running port 3000) still returns full
  `functionalModel` data (traces/source/synergy) unchanged.

- Known, separate, NOT fixed here (flagged, not this hotfix's job):
  `server/utils/functionalModelPool.ts`'s own comment already admits this
  — even though it degrades gracefully (empty pool) rather than crashing,
  the whole Interactions cross-card panel and this card's own synergy
  overlay are effectively **disabled in production** once
  `functional-model/` genuinely isn't in the deployed bundle (confirmed:
  real Netlify deploy won't have the dir at all, unlike my local
  `npm run build` test above where the dir was still on disk from repo
  root — that only proved the DCE/guard works, not that the pool actually
  gets real cards on Netlify). Restoring real production coverage would
  need bundling the committed per-card `synergy.json`/`trace.json`/
  `progress.json` (e.g. Nitro `serverAssets`) and rewriting every reader
  (this route + `functionalModelPool.ts`) off raw `fs`/dynamic `import()`
  onto Nitro's storage API — `definition.ts`'s dynamic import in
  particular has no clean Lambda-compatible equivalent (raw TS source,
  not a bundle-traceable import). Real follow-up, own decision, not
  smuggled into this hotfix.
